# Project 6 - *Instagram*

**Instagram** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **11** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [ ] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [ ] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [ ] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [ ] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Is it possible to allow user to edit pictures like on actual Instagram app.
2. Allow users signed up to find posts by other users.

Table View was giving trouble to actually display posts till the Query code was figured out
